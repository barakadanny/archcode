# RISC-V Assembly Exercises 🧠⚙️

## 🧠 What is RISC-V?

**RISC-V** (pronounced "risk-five") is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). Unlike proprietary architectures like x86 or ARM, RISC-V is open-source and designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, making it ideal for learning, research, and innovation.

You are an aspiring computer engineer, systems programmer, or just curious about how software talks to hardware, RISC-V is an accessible and forward-thinking way to explore low-level programming.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run these `.asm` files using [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars), a lightweight RISC-V simulator for educational use.

1. Download and open RARS.
2. Load any `.asm` file from the repo.
3. Assemble and run the program.
4. Follow the input prompts and observe the output in the console.
